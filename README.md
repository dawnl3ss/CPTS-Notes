### CPTS preparation notes

--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

Hi ! I am Dawnl3ss, a French 18 year-old computer science engineering student at EPITA.

I am found of cybersecurity and CompSci since my childhood. It feels like a dream to me to have the opportunity of studying cybersecurity with HTB Academy even though I am fully aware of the complexity and the difficulty of its courses.

My goal is to finish the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist job role path by august 2025. We are currently June 30, 2024. Thus, I have a full year and one month to complete my goals. Yes I know, I can be very hopeful because it is said that the CPTS job role path is very hard but I believe I have my chances.

In this "journal", I will write all my notes and my thoughts throughout my learning journey but I will also talk about my difficulties and my worries alongside.

Before starting, I wanted to write my learning schedule.

In France, we have two month of summer vacations during July and Auguste, re-starting school September the first. Therefore, I have 2 months free to try to progress as far as I can.
