### CPTS preparation notes

--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

Hi ! I am Dawnl3ss, a French 18 year-old computer science engineering student at EPITA.

I am found of cyber-security and CompSci since my childhood. It feels like a dream to me to have the opportunity of studying cyber-security with HTB Academy even though I am fully aware of the complexity and the difficulty of its courses.

My goal is to finish the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist job role path by august 2025. We are currently June 30, 2024. Thus, I have a full year and one month to complete my goals. Yes I know, I can be very hopeful because it is said that the CPTS job role path is very hard but I believe I have my chances.

In this "journal", I will write all my notes and my thoughts throughout my learning journey but I will also talk about my difficulties and my worries alongside.

Before starting, I wanted to write my learning schedule :

In France, we have two months of summer vacations during July and August, re-starting school September the first. Therefore, I have 2 months free to try to progress as far as I can. 

From September the first to the end of December, I will be in school. I will therefore have far less time dedicated to my cyber-security learning journey. I reckon that I will only learn things during week-ends and vacations.

From January to June 2025, I will do a semester abroad, in California State University: Los Angeles. Knowing that the courses and lessons in the USA are way more easier than in my engineering school, I will have plenty of time to learn but also to discover this huge and beautiful country ahah.

To put it in a nutshell, my goal is to increase my knowledge through the year and enjoying my life in the same time.

During these to next months, I will study 1h every day, from 9:00PM to 10:00PM.


Thanks for reading,
Dawnless.
