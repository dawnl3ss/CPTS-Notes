### Update through my learning journey.

--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

Well, this was by far my worst failure ever.

During all summer, I dodged the learning because I was too tired to learn things. In fact, my summer job took all my free time away and swept my determination.

I was working from 10:00am to 7:00pm in a Costco, standing here and there and selling products to customers. Pretty boring actually...

But here we are, in September 2024, school restarts and I will be focused on other things than this project. 

But all of a sudden, I regained determination and I will do everything I can to progress.

See ya latter, future me.
