### Active Directory Terminology

-------
----

Before going further, we should determine some keywords related to Active Directory that will be useful during our journey.

#### Objects :

An **`object`** defines ANY resource you can find in an Active Directory environment. It can be users, printers, domains etc...

#### Attributes :

Every `object` of the AD has a set of values named **`attributes`** used to define the characteristics of the given `object`.

#### Domains :

A **`domain`** is a logical group of objects (such as computers, users etc) linked between them. We can compare each domain of a `forest` to different cities in a same state or country.

#### Forests :

A **`forest`** is a collection of Active Directory `domains`. It is the topmost container and gathers all of the AD `Objects` listed bellow. We also can compare a `forest` with a state in the US.
